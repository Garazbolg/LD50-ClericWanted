For Ludum Dare 50


# Summary :

This is a game in which you play as a Cleric that just arrive in a small village. There aren't enough clerics to go around so everyone wants to join your party.

Recruit your party and go into the dungeon trying to **heal them until they inevitably die**. Well the only thing that matters to you is your own life, so don't forget to get out before you die too.


# Input :

**Everything is playable with the mouse**. For combat you can also use Q/A, W/Z, E and R to cast your spells.
You need to select your target by clicking them at the top of the Battle screen.


# Context :

Haven't finished a Ludum dare in a while so I'm glad to be back. 
I actually wasn't aware it was happening so I started about 10 hours after. And I started with another idea that got fully scrapped after 21 hours after the start of the jam. So this is basically a **27 hours jam for me**. Fun times =)

The original plan was to have way more content : Enemies and party members, spells, add items (the code is mostly there). And have multiple dungeons. But that's a scope problem and I can always add more later.
